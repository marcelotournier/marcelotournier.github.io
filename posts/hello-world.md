Hey! This is my personal website.

I work building Machine Learning technologies in healthcare, mostly using text 
and Natural Language Processing.

In this site, you will see some of my tech projects, news and relevant articles in
Machine Learning, and occasionally some random rants about stuff I think it's interesting.
