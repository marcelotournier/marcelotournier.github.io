Hey - Marcelo here.

I am a tech-seasoned Physician + Programmer who loves to build models in TensorFlow, Spark, Scala, Python, Java & R, bringing data to life.

Before working with AI, I was a Product Manager, with 10+ years building technologies (Apps, IoT, Machine Learning). I championed the design of data-driven approaches for healthcare, winning national awards of excellence and one patent.

In the recent past, I was an advisor of Data science startups in Brazil, and in the leisure time I run without commitments (I wonder if someday I will go to a marathon).
